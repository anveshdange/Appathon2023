Problem Statement : 
 "Build an app that can suggest internship programs to students"
 
 We have designed this code with the help of dart programming language and the flutter framework. 
 
 To run this app on your local system Please ensure that you have flutter installed in your systems.
 Make sure that you can run flutter doctor on your system. 
 
 Once you can run flutter doctor and do not find any issues then run the command 
 "flutter run"

Happy fluttering !!
